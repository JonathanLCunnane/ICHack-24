To clone and get the Django web app working, another user would need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Replace <your-repo-url> with the URL of your actual repository.

Navigate into the project directory:
Replace myproject with the name of your project directory.

Create a new virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.venv\Scripts\activate
On Unix or MacOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run migrations:
python -m pip install Django
python manage.py migrate
This will apply all the migrations and create the necessary database schema.

Start the Django server:
python manage.py runserver
This will start the Django development server. The user can then access the web app by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in their web browser.

Please note that these instructions assume that the user has Python and Git installed on their machine.
